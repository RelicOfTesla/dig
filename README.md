* Fast dependency injection(DI) container in go (golang)
* like [uber-go/dig](https://github.com/uber-go/dig) library, but better than it :) .


# This Future
  * Split build and call, fast call speed in product.
  * Support user custom provider.
  * Support delay inject. (dynamic inject from call argument)
  * Thread safely.

# Example
  see [request_di_test.go](dig2/request_di_test.go) , [container_test.go](dig2/container_test.go)
  

# Some TODO
  * some uber.dig test function not cover.
  * ptr auto cast
